# **Superar Communication Consulting**


[Superar](https://catast11.github.io/Superar-Comm-Consulting/) - Superar Communication Consulting - is the first website I have ever created. 
The website was the objective drawn within the milestone project in the Full stack development school.

The story of this project idea is rather simple. 
Behind this project is a fictitious consulting company. The call of creating this “communication company” came
due to the unfortunate global situation in the beginning of 2020, the global pandemic of COVID-19. 
I observed that a lot of companies were forced to adopt a crisis situation type of communication.  
The pandemic created more than just a health crisis, but also a financial and a communication crisis.


## UX 


As a communication consulting company, _our_ main target partners are other companies, 
but in order to be highly efficient, _we_ need to have a holistic approach. 
Therefore, _we’ll_ keep in mind the importance of internal communication and the relation with the partners' employees. 
<br />In conclusion, _our_ website addresses as well to employees, as secondary targets.

The main traits had in mind when conceiving the website were simplicity and ease of access and navigation.
The information should not overflow and more details or debriefing are offered upon request.

The appearance and the functionality of this website were the subject of a short survey and the website suffered a few changes
 between the initial sketch and the second sketch. 
The idea behind the project being a very simple one, it was considered that it’s no need of any specific and more complex wireframes. 

The link below contains two files that reveal the two sketches.

## Features

The website contains three pages: Index - home page -, Our Advice and Contact.

The three pages have a range of common elements: Header, Signature, Footer and Leaf image - placed right above the footer.

_The Header_ contains the Logo / Home button centred and styled and the navigation bar containing links to Advice page and Contact page, 
pushed to the left.

_The Footer_ contains the Call to Action (CTA) and the social media interactive links where the company can be reached. 

_The Signature_ is placed right under the Header and is pushed to the right.

_Index_ page contains relevant information about the company as well as relevant images to the context.

_Our Advice_ page contains a glimpse of advice for employees and employers regarding the work from home period 
and the possibility of downloading two full documents with extended advice. The page also contains two relevant images.

_Contact_ page contains a Welcome and a contact form.


### Features left to implement

* Case studies
* Testimonials from partners
* Details about technologies in use
* Media presentations
* Communication trends


## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* BootstrapCDN
* Gitpod
* Font Awesome

## Testing

The website was tested within various browsers: Chrome, Safari, FireFox; and on various mobile terminals:
 Samsung Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, iPhone 5, 6, 7, 8, X, iPad, iPad Pro.
It proved to be responsive and functioned well on all devices, telephones and tablets.

* All links responded correctly to the test. Navigation bar links drove easily within the site 
while social media links opened in new webpages. 
* The document download links had a proper response 
and opened the documents in new pages.
* The contact form needs to have all the fields properly filled in in order to function - as designed.

_Issues that need to be fixed:_

* Fine tuning for the elements’ margin property, as they were not perfectly centred
 due to the previous float property applied to classes right-side and left-side. - This happened on only few terminals with lower resolution.

* Social media links need to be centred for some terminals with lower resolution - e.g. iPhone5

* Fine tuning for eliminating the negative space. e.g. Pixel 2.
